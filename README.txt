A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/edmondko/pen/udcHG.

 This is a little task I did for a job application. I thought it's a decent example for showing off my skills as a Front-ender. This example is purely visible only, it doesn't save any notes.

This codepen can be used by anybody who finds it suitable for his needs.
